Monetization Roadmap for ACME/Signing Platform

1. Define Pricing Tiers
   - Outline 3–4 plans (Basic, Pro, Enterprise, etc.) with clear quotas, SLAs, support levels.
   - Choose a billing model: flat monthly, per-request, or overage-based pricing.

2. Extend Account Model
   - Add DB fields: stripe_customer_id, billing_status, plan, usage_limit, next_billing_date.
   - Provide a migration to backfill existing free-tier accounts.

3. Integrate Payments Provider
   - Install and configure Stripe (or equivalent) SDK with secure API keys.
   - Implement /billing/checkout endpoint to create checkout sessions.
   - Implement /billing/webhook endpoint to handle events (invoice.paid, payment_failed, subscription.updated).
   - Update billing_status and plan based on webhook events.

4. Enforce Billing & Quotas in API
   - Enhance clientAuth middleware to validate billing_status and plan.
   - Reject past-due or canceled accounts with HTTP 402 (Payment Required).
   - Enforce per-period usage_limit and auto-reset counts at next_billing_date.

5. Build Self-Service Endpoints
   - /plans: list available plans and pricing details.
   - /account: display account info, usage stats, billing status.
   - /invoices: list and download past invoices.
   - Endpoints to upgrade/downgrade plan and update payment method.

6. Reporting & Alerts
   - Instrument metrics for subscriptions, renewals, cancellations, and usage by tier.
   - Set up alerts for payment failures, past-due accounts, and churn spikes.

7. Update Documentation & Marketing
   - Publish a pricing page and API key signup flow in README or website.
   - Add guides for onboarding, billing, and troubleshooting payment issues.

8. Compliance & Security
   - Use hosted checkout to minimize PCI scope.
   - Isolate billing workflows in a separate service or module.

9. Rollout Strategy
   - Launch monetization behind a feature flag or allow-list.
   - Monitor MRR, conversion rates, API usage, and customer feedback.
   - Iterate pricing and quotas based on real-world data.
